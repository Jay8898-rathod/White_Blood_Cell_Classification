Task: White Blood Cell Classification

The objective of this task is to train a machine learning model to classify different types of white blood cells (WBCs). The specific types of WBCs to be classified are as follows: bands, basophils, blasts, eosinophils, lymphocytes, metamyelocytes, monocytes, myelocytes, and neutrophils. Data is given in the attachment. Once the model is trained, write a program to utilize the trained model for classifying images stored in the "classify-images" folder into the aforementioned classes.

Here I have used Google colab to build the CNN architure model that is I have build the VGG16 architecture model on 500 epochs.
